            <p>We saw in our testing that users had a great deal of trouble finding the ifixit blog and Teardown pages. To address this, we've moved that section of the footer menu to the top as a submenu. We felt that while it does have an impact on their minimalist design aesthetic, these sections of their website were too important to be left to the footer, especially the teardowns.</p>
